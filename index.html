	<p style="font-family: Cursive"; font size:"20"; align="left"><b><center>This is me and my story: I'm from "Elay" where I spent eighteen years in sunshine before moving to the Bay Area which, at the time, I suspected was the coldest place in the world. A move to New York would correct that realization, as would a subsequent move to London. To defrost, I moved to Hong Kong and then Phuket before returning to the bitter cold of America, this time to a city called Boston. Before I could run back to the tropics, I fell in love and it's been scarves and gloves ever since.</b></center></p>
